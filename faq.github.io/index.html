                <span>What is the bond about?

            </button>
            <p>The bond is just an assurance that you are going to work in the company till you
                graduate. Once you enter the company you will stay here going through the training
                program and complete the instructed work on time.
                </p>

        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>Can I work in another company as an intern?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Yes you can, there is no restriction saying that you cannot work in another despite
                having a bond here. We will specifically mention it in the bond saying that you are
                free to work in some other companies (It should be duly informed and get prior
                approval from the respective Director/CEO/Program Manager).</p>

        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>Am I paid?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Technically no. It is unpaid initially. But you’ll be getting company shares if you join
                the company.<br>
                Later, when the investment is done by any investor. We will be paying you in salary.
                </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>What is the benefit of holding the shares in the company?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
            </button>
            <p>1. You will sell the shares back to the company and get the equivalent money from it
                when you leave/when you graduate (it will only be exchanged after reaching a
                threshold valuation of ₹100Cr).<br><br>
                2. Anyone joining the company is expected to have at least 2-3% (worth ₹2cr at 100cr
                valuation) of company shares (if the candidate opts to work till they graduate, the %
                will decrease according to your working years). A maximum of
                ₹10-20 Lakhs will be given each in exchange for the shares.<br><br>
                3. Can I continue to hold the shares after the mentioned terms? It is completely
                negotiable and is left to the founder to decide on it.
                </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>Why am I signing the bond?
                </span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
            </button>
            <p> 1. This is not a bond that restricts you. Instead, it gives you an opportunity by not
                restricting you to only work in our company. The bond gives you the freedom to work
                in another company (but you should at least work here for 1.5 Years after the
                training program and not leave in between).<br><br>
                2. We are giving the students a training program (can also be used as an internship)
                which at least goes up to 6 months. If the company is investing its time and energy in
                training the students free of cost we at least expect some useful work from the
                candidate for the next 1.5 Years. If the students keep on leaving the company after
                the training program, then finding another person, training them again, and making
                them understand the project is too tedious work for the company. Though the bond
                duration is long, the company is giving some concessions that you can still work in
                some other companies, there is no huge restriction as such.<br><br>
                3. Any startup/initially started company will start with a few trusted people. The
                company is answerable to all the employees. Imagine there’s a ML specialist in the
                team, he leaves in between and there is no other expert who can do that job. Then the
                whole project might get halted and this will intern affect the other people in the team.
                To ensure these things do not happen we are asking you to sign a bond.<br><br>
                4. Imagine that an investor walks in. Now, he sets certain deadlines and the work has to
                be accomplished within that time frame. Otherwise, the company's funds will be
                stopped and we might not get funds in the next round of investment. This will
                seriously affect the company and its employees.

        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>What will be the working hours expected?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Typically 1 hour a day on regular days and 4 hours on holidays.<br>
                But, if we are very near to approaching an investor/going for the next round of
                funding, then we might expect around 1.5-2 hrs a day (this could last a maximum of 1
                month).

        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>Do I have to come to the office/co-working space to do the job?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Mostly no, you can do the designated work at the place of your ease.<br>
                But, you will at least meet (at CMRIT college/office in case of any, in the future) the
                CEO/Program Manager/Project Manager 2-3 times a month and report all the
                progress of your work.
            </p>

        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>What do we do in the meeting?</span>

            </button>
            <p>Reporting the assigned work's progress to the respective CEO/Program
                Manager/Project Manager.<br>
                Discussion about the ongoing projects with the whole team.<br>
                Planning and strategizing for any hackathons/Competitions (if we have applied for
                any).
